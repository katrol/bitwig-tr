Bitwig Controller Script for Korg TR

In A-mode, the knobs will control the four first parameters of a page. In B-mode, the knobs when set to KMod1 through KMod4 (CC#17, CC#19, CC#20, CC#21) will control the four last parameters of a page. SW1 will go to the previous parameter page when set to SW1 Mod (CC#80) and SW2 will go to the next parameter page when set to SW2 Mod (CC#81).

This will likely work for Korg keyboards similar to the TR as well, but it has only been tested on a TR.
